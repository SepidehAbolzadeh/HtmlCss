            Night (also described as nighttime, unconventionally spelled as "nite") is the period of 
            ambient darkness from sunset to sunrise during each 24-hour day, when the Sun is below the 
            horizon. The exact time when night begins and ends depends on the location and varies throughout 
            the year, based on factors such as season and latitude.

            A sea is a large body of salty water. There are particular seas and the sea. 
            The sea commonly refers to the ocean, the wider body of seawater. Particular 
            seas are either marginal seas, second-order sections of the oceanic sea 
            (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain large, nearly landlocked bodies of water.

            Waterfalls can be formed in several ways, but the most common method of formation is that a river
             courses over a top layer of resistant bedrock before falling on to softer rock, which erodes faster,
              leading to an increasingly high fall. Waterfalls have been studied for their impact on species 
              living in and around them.
