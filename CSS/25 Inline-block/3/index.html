        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
        XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation
        of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more
        flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
        complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
        share the file and its formatting.Separation of formatting and content
        also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
        styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by
        voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
        tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
        content is accessed on a mobile device.
