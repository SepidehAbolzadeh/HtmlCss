            <p class="aboutcss">presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
                (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone
                 technology of the World Wide Web, <span class="spanincss">alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
                colors, and fonts.</span> This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more 
                flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable 
                multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
                .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and 
                enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages
                that share the file and its formatting.</p>

            <p class="abouthtml">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be 
                displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. <span class="spaninhtml">
                It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents 
                into multimedia web pages.</span> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
                included cues for its appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
                With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the 
                rendered page.</p>
