        <h1>RIVER</h1>
        <p>A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually a freshwater stream, flowing on the 
            surface or inside caves towards another waterbody at a lower elevation, such as an ocean, 
            sea, bay, lake, wetland, or another river. In some cases, a river flows into the ground or 
            becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers 
            can be referred to by names such as creek, brook, and rivulet. There are no official 
            definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features,[1] although in 
            some countries or communities, a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers 
            are specific to geographic location; examples are "run" in some parts of the United States,
             "burn" in Scotland and Northeast England, and "beck" in Northern England. Sometimes a river 
             is defined as being larger than a creek,[2] but not always; the language is vague.</p>
