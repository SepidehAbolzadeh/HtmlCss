          Night (also described as nighttime, unconventionally spelled as
          "nite") is the period of ambient darkness from sunset to sunrise
          during each 24-hour day, when the Sun is below the horizon. The exact
          time when night begins and ends depends on the location and varies
          throughout the year, based on factors such as season and latitude.

          A sea is a large body of salty water. There are particular seas and
          the sea. The sea commonly refers to the ocean, the wider body of
          seawater. Particular seas are either marginal seas, second-order
          sections of the oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain
          large, nearly landlocked bodies of water.

          Waterfalls can be formed in several ways, but the most common method
          of formation is that a river courses over a top layer of resistant
          bedrock before falling on to softer rock, which erodes faster, leading
          to an increasingly high fall. Waterfalls have been studied for their
          impact on species living in and around them.
