        A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust,
        and dark matter bound together by gravity. The word is derived from the
        Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky
        Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an
        estimated 100 million stars, range in size from dwarfs with less than a
        hundred million stars, to the largest galaxies known supergiants with
        one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.
